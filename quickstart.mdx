## Step 1: Install the extension

<Card title="Chrome Web Store" icon="chrome" href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/web2md-web-to-markdown/ijmgpkkfgpijifldbjafjiapehppcbcn">
  Install Web2MD from the Chrome Web Store. It's free — no account required to get started.
</Card>

After installation, you'll see the Web2MD icon ( **.MD** ) in your browser toolbar. Pin it for easy access.

## Step 2: Convert your first page

Navigate to any webpage, then choose one of these methods:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Click the extension icon" icon="puzzle-piece">
    1. Click the Web2MD icon in the toolbar
    2. Click **Convert**
    3. The page content is converted to Markdown instantly
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use the keyboard shortcut" icon="keyboard">
    Press `Alt+M` (or `Option+M` on Mac) to convert the current page. This works on any tab without opening the popup.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Right-click context menu" icon="ellipsis-vertical">
    Right-click anywhere on the page and select **Copy page as Markdown**. If you have text selected, it will convert only the selection.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Step 3: Use the output

After conversion, you'll see the result panel with several options:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Copy** | Copy Markdown to clipboard |
| **Download** | Save as a `.md` file |
| **Send to AI** | Open Claude, ChatGPT, or Gemini with the content |
| **Save to Obsidian** | Send to your Obsidian vault (if enabled) |

You'll also see helpful stats: **word count**, **token count**, and **estimated reading time**.

<Tip>
Enable **Auto copy** in Settings to automatically copy the Markdown to your clipboard after every conversion.
