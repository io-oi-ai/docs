## Overview

Web2MD can send converted Markdown directly to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) using the `obsidian://` URI protocol. This lets you save web content to your vault without leaving the browser.

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Obsidian integration">
    Go to **Settings → Obsidian** and toggle **Enable Obsidian export**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set your vault name (optional)">
    If you have multiple Obsidian vaults, enter the vault name to target a specific one. Leave blank to use the default vault.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make sure Obsidian is running">
    Obsidian must be open on your computer for the URI protocol to work.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Usage

After converting a page:

1. Click the **Save to Obsidian** button in the result panel
2. Obsidian opens and creates a new note with the Markdown content
3. The note title is set to the page title

## How it works

Web2MD uses Obsidian's [URI protocol](https://help.obsidian.md/Extending+Obsidian/Obsidian+URI):

```
obsidian://new?vault=MyVault&name=Article%20Title&content=...
```

This creates a new note in the specified vault with the converted Markdown as content.

<Warning>
The `obsidian://` protocol has URL length limits. Very long articles may be truncated. For long content, consider using **Copy** and pasting directly into Obsidian.
</Warning>

## Settings

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Enable Obsidian export** | Show/hide the "Save to Obsidian" button |
| **Vault name** | Target vault (leave blank for default) |
