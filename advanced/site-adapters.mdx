## Overview

While Web2MD works on any webpage, certain sites benefit from specialized extraction logic. Site adapters use each platform's API or DOM structure to produce better Markdown output than generic extraction.

## Supported sites

### Reddit

- Post title, author, subreddit, and score

### GitHub

- Title, status (open/closed/merged), and labels

- English subtitles/captions (when available)

### Stack Overflow

- Question title, body, tags, and vote count
- Accepted answer (highlighted)
- Top answers with vote counts

### Twitter / X

## How adapters work

When you convert a page, Web2MD automatically:

1. **Detects the site** from the URL
2. **Selects the best adapter** if one exists
3. **Extracts content** using the site-specific method
4. **Falls back** to generic extraction if the adapter fails

You don't need to configure anything — adapters are applied automatically.

<Info>
Site adapters are available to all users (Free and Pro). They run before the main conversion pipeline, so they work regardless of your plan.
