<Steps>
  <Step title="Click the primary button">
    Click **Copy page** to instantly copy the current page as Markdown. No dropdown needed for the most common action.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open the dropdown">
    Click the **↑ arrow** on the right side of the button to reveal all available actions.

## Why a split button?

Previously, you needed to go into Settings to switch between Copy, Send to AI, or View modes. The Action Menu exposes all actions at once — no settings navigation required.

<Tip>
Use **Copy page** for quick clipboard workflows. Use the AI shortcuts when you want to immediately ask questions about a page's content.
