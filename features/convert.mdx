## Overview

Web2MD's core feature is converting any webpage into clean Markdown. It strips ads, navigation, sidebars, and other clutter — leaving only the content you care about.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Get clean Markdown">
    Web2MD extracts the main content, removes clutter, and generates well-structured Markdown.

### Stats bar

|--------|-------------|
| **Words** | Total word count of the extracted content |
| **Tokens** | Estimated token count (avg 4 chars = 1 token) — useful for AI context limits |
| **Read** | Estimated reading time (based on 200 words/min) |

### Preview modes

Toggle between two views:

- **Preview** — Rendered Markdown with headings, lists, code blocks, and images
- **Source** — Raw Markdown text, ready to copy and paste

## What gets extracted

Web2MD uses a two-phase DOM cleaning process:

1. **Phase 1** — Always removes: `<script>`, `<style>`, `<nav>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<aside>`
2. **Phase 2** — Removes block-level distractions (ads, sidebars, social sharing) while preserving inline elements

### Content preserved

- Headings and hierarchy
- Paragraphs and text formatting (bold, italic, strikethrough)
- Lists (ordered and unordered)
- Code blocks with language detection
- Images with alt text
- Links (toggleable in settings)
- Tables
- Blockquotes

### Metadata (optional)

When **Add metadata** is enabled in settings, the output includes:

```markdown
---
title: "Article Title"
source: https://example.com/article
date: 2025-01-15T10:30:00.000Z
---
```

## Selection mode

Select specific text on a page before converting to extract **only the selected content** instead of the full page. This works via:

- The extension popup (click Convert with text selected)
- Right-click → **Copy selection as Markdown**

<Tip>
Selection mode is great for extracting specific sections from long articles or forum threads.

## Keyboard shortcut

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Alt+M` / `Option+M` | Convert the current page |

The shortcut works on any tab without needing to open the popup.
