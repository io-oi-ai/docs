## Menu options

### Without text selected

| Menu item | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| **Copy page as Markdown** | Convert the full page and copy to clipboard |
| **Convert & Send to [AI]** | Convert and send to your preferred AI platform |

### With text selected

| Menu item | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| **Copy selection as Markdown** | Convert only the selected text and copy to clipboard |
| **Convert & Send to [AI]** | Convert the selection and send to your preferred AI platform |

## Dynamic AI platform name

The context menu dynamically displays the name of your preferred AI platform. For example, if you set Claude as your default, you'll see:

> Convert & Send to **Claude**

Change the platform in **Settings → Preferred AI platform**, and the context menu updates automatically.

## Preview card integration

When you use the context menu to convert a page, a [Preview Card](/features/preview-card) appears in the top-right corner (if enabled in settings), giving you additional actions like Copy All and Send All.

<Tip>
The context menu is the fastest way to convert — right-click anywhere and you're done. Combine with **Auto copy** for a zero-friction workflow.
