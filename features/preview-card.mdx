## Overview

When you convert a page using the keyboard shortcut (`Alt+M`) or the context menu, a floating preview card appears in the top-right corner of the page. This lets you take action without opening the popup.

## Card features

Each preview card shows:

- **Page title** of the converted content
- **Word count** summary
- **Checkbox** to select/deselect the card
- **Close button** to dismiss

### Bottom action bar

When one or more cards are selected:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Copy All** | Copy all selected cards' Markdown to clipboard |
| **Send All** | Send all selected content to your preferred AI platform |

## Multiple cards

You can stack up to **5 preview cards** at once. This is useful when converting multiple pages in sequence — each conversion adds a new card.

## Display duration

Control how long cards stay visible in **Settings → Show preview card**:

| Duration | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| **5 seconds** | Card auto-dismisses after 5s |
| **15 seconds** | Card auto-dismisses after 15s |
| **30 seconds** | Card auto-dismisses after 30s |
| **Always** | Card persists until manually closed. Survives page refresh. |

<Info>
In **Always** mode, cards are persisted to `chrome.storage.local` and will reappear after page refresh. Use **Clear all cards** in Settings to remove them.
</Info>

## Toggle preview card

You can disable the preview card entirely in **Settings → Show preview card**. When disabled, conversions via shortcut/context menu will still work but won't show a visual indicator.
