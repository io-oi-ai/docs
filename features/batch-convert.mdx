## Progress tracking

During batch conversion, you'll see real-time progress:

- **Progress bar** with percentage completion
- Individual status for each URL:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Pending | Waiting to be processed |
| Converting | Currently being converted |
| Success | Conversion completed |
| Error | Conversion failed (e.g. page not reachable) |
| Skipped | URL was invalid or not supported |

## Results

After completion, you'll see a summary:

- Total **successful** conversions
- Total **failed** / **skipped** conversions
- Actions: **Copy All** (all results combined) or **Download All** (individual `.md` files)

Click **New Batch** to start another batch conversion.

<Tip>
Batch conversion works best with article pages and blog posts. Dynamic single-page apps may produce less consistent results.
